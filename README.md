## Visual Interface
The visual interface for managing access control rules and permissions can be found at [this link](https://github.com/wnikk/laravel-access-ui).
It offers an intuitive and user-friendly environment for administrators to define roles, assign permissions, and configure access rules.

For detailed usage examples and instructions, refer to the [example repository](https://github.com/wnikk/-laravel-access-example).

## Documentation, Installation, and Usage Instructions

See the [documentation](https://github.com/wnikk/laravel-access-rules/tree/master/docs) for detailed installation and usage instructions.

## Versions & Dependencies

| Laravel Access Control Rules | PHP       | Laravel |
|------------------------------|-----------|---------|
| 2.x+                         | 7.4 - 8.4 | 8 - 12  |
| 1.x                          | 7.1 - 7.3 | 5.5 - 8 |

## You can install the package using composer:

```bash
composer require wnikk/laravel-access-rules
```

See the [installation page](https://github.com/wnikk/laravel-access-rules/blob/main/docs/installation.md) for detailed.


## What It Does
This package allows you to manage user permissions and groups (instead roles) in a database.

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
use Wnikk\LaravelAccessRules\AccessRules;

// Add new rule permission
AccessRules::newRule('articles.edit', 'Access to editing articles');
```
```php
// Adding permissions to a user
$user->addPermission('articles.edit');
```


Or you can inherit the rights from another user or groups

```php
// According to the existing user from object
$user->inheritPermissionFrom(User::find(1));

// By identifier
$user->inheritPermissionFrom(User::class, 1);

// From the group
$user->inheritPermissionFrom('Group', 1);
```


Because all permissions will be registered on **Laravel's gate**, you can check if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('articles.edit'); 
```

Or without model:

```php
$acr = new AccessRules;
$acr->setOwner('AnotherAnySystemUser', 'UserID-From-Any-System-FF01');
$check = $acr->can('articles.edit');
if (!$check) {abort(403);}
```

Examples of how can be used in more detail described in [Basic Usage](https://github.com/wnikk/laravel-access-rules/blob/main/docs/basic-usage.md) section.
